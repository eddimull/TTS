In the event of such non-performance, the deposit payment (if any) advanced to the Artist shall be returned promptly. Artist is responsible for securing reliable transportation to the performance, and any transportation issues that arise do not in any way affect Artist's duty to perform pursuant to the terms of this Agreement. Artist shall not be reimbursed or compensated by Buyer for additional costs resulting from transportation issues, either foreseen or unforeseen."
