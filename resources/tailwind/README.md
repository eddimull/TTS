This is a workaround for generating pdfs. Specifically, locally. Rather than trying to include a tailwind file locally with the @vite method, this will build out the view for rendering out PDFs. The PDF.blade will pull the contents of the tailwind.min.js file. 

Otherwise, browsershot will try to grab css and js from https://localhost:8710... but browsershot doesn't know where localhost is. On top of that, this is getting around ssl cert errors.
