# Rehearsal System Implementation

## Overview
This implementation adds a comprehensive rehearsal management system to TTS Bandmate that integrates seamlessly with the existing booking and event infrastructure. The system is **fully functional** with complete backend and frontend components.

## Status: ✅ COMPLETE

The rehearsal system is ready to use with:
- ✅ Full CRUD operations for rehearsal schedules
- ✅ Full CRUD operations for individual rehearsals  
- ✅ Event calendar integration
- ✅ Google Calendar sync
- ✅ Dashboard integration (rehearsals appear alongside bookings)
- ✅ Navigation menu integration
- ✅ Permission system integration
- ✅ Booking association system
- ✅ Responsive design with dark mode support

## Architecture

### Data Model

The rehearsal system uses a two-tier structure:

1. **RehearsalSchedule** (Parent) - Tied to a band
   - Contains recurring rehearsal information (weekly, biweekly, etc.)
   - Stores default location and notes
   - Has many Rehearsals

2. **Rehearsal** (Child) - The eventable entity
   - Belongs to a RehearsalSchedule
   - Can have custom venue/location per instance
   - Links to Events via polymorphic relationship (eventable)
   - Can be associated with Bookings/Events via `rehearsal_associations` pivot table

3. **RehearsalAssociation** (Pivot) - Links rehearsals to bookings/events
   - Allows tracking which bookings a rehearsal is preparing for

### Database Tables

```sql
-- Main tables
rehearsal_schedules (id, band_id, name, description, frequency, location_name, location_address, notes, active)
rehearsals (id, rehearsal_schedule_id, venue_name, venue_address, notes, additional_data)
rehearsal_associations (id, rehearsal_id, associable_type, associable_id, notes)

-- Permissions
user_permissions.read_rehearsals (boolean)
user_permissions.write_rehearsals (boolean)
```

### Polymorphic Relationships

The `events` table links to rehearsals via:
- `eventable_type` = 'App\\Models\\Rehearsal'
- `eventable_id` = rehearsal.id

This allows rehearsals to appear in the event calendar just like bookings.

## Google Calendar Integration

### How it Works

1. **Rehearsal Model** implements `GoogleCalenderable` interface
2. When a rehearsal event is created, it's written to Google Calendar via `CalendarService`
3. The `getGoogleCalendar()` method accesses the band through `rehearsal->rehearsalSchedule->band`
4. `CalendarEventFormatter::formatRehearsalDescription()` generates the calendar event description

### Key Methods

- `getGoogleCalendarSummary()` - Returns event title
- `getGoogleCalendarDescription()` - Formatted description with schedule info, location, associated bookings
- `getGoogleCalendarLocation()` - Returns venue with address
- `getGoogleCalendarColor()` - Returns color ID (5 = yellow for rehearsals)

## Controllers & Routes

### RehearsalScheduleController
- CRUD operations for rehearsal schedules
- Permission checking via `canRead('rehearsals', $band->id)` and `canWrite('rehearsals', $band->id)`

### RehearsalController
- CRUD operations for individual rehearsals
- Creates both Rehearsal and Event records
- Handles Google Calendar sync via CalendarService
- Manages associations with bookings

### Routes
All routes are nested under bands:
```
/bands/{band}/rehearsal-schedules
/bands/{band}/rehearsal-schedules/{schedule}/rehearsals
```

## Permissions System

Added to `User` model:
- `canRead($resource, $bandId)` - Generic permission checker
- `canWrite($resource, $bandId)` - Generic permission checker

These methods check:
1. If user owns the band (automatic permission)
2. Otherwise, check user_permissions table for resource-specific permissions

## Vue Components (Completed)

Created in `resources/js/Pages/Rehearsals/`:
- **Index.vue** - List of rehearsal schedules with cards, active status, and navigation
- **ScheduleForm.vue** - Create/edit rehearsal schedule form with validation
- **ScheduleDetail.vue** - Individual schedule view with list of all rehearsals
- **RehearsalForm.vue** - Create/edit rehearsal form with event data, venue info, and booking associations
- **RehearsalDetail.vue** - Individual rehearsal view showing all details, venue, notes, and associated bookings

All components follow existing TTS Bandmate patterns:
- Using Container, Button, Input, Label, TextArea components
- Dark mode support via Tailwind classes
- Inertia.js integration with useForm composable
- Proper error handling with InputError component
- Responsive design matching existing pages

## Usage Flow

1. **Create a Rehearsal Schedule** for a band (e.g., "Weekly Practice")
2. **Add Rehearsals** to the schedule with specific dates/times
3. Each rehearsal automatically creates an **Event** record
4. Events sync to **Google Calendar** via CalendarService
5. Optionally **associate rehearsals** with upcoming bookings to track what you're preparing for
6. Rehearsals appear in the **main event calendar** alongside bookings

## Migration Commands

```bash
# Run migrations
php artisan migrate

# The following tables will be created:
# - rehearsal_schedules
# - rehearsals  
# - rehearsal_associations
# And user_permissions will be updated with read_rehearsals/write_rehearsals

# Generate Ziggy routes for frontend
php artisan ziggy:generate
```

## How to Use the Rehearsal System

### For Band Owners

1. **Navigate to Rehearsals** - Click "Rehearsals" in the main navigation menu

2. **Create a Rehearsal Schedule**
   - Click "Create Rehearsal Schedule"
   - Provide a name (e.g., "Weekly Practice", "Pre-Tour Rehearsals")
   - Set frequency (weekly, biweekly, monthly, custom)
   - Add default location information (can be overridden per rehearsal)
   - Mark as active/inactive
   - Save the schedule

3. **Add Rehearsals to a Schedule**
   - Click on a schedule to view details
   - Click "Add Rehearsal"
   - Fill in event information (title, date, time, event type)
   - Optionally override venue information
   - Add rehearsal-specific notes
   - Optionally link to upcoming bookings you're preparing for
   - Save the rehearsal

4. **View in Dashboard**
   - Rehearsals appear in the main dashboard calendar alongside bookings
   - Rehearsal events are marked with the schedule name (e.g., "Rehearsal: Weekly Practice")

5. **Google Calendar Sync**
   - Rehearsals automatically sync to the band's Google Calendar
   - Updates are synced when editing rehearsals
   - Deletions are reflected in Google Calendar

### For Band Members

- Members with "read_rehearsals" permission can view rehearsal schedules and details
- Members with "write_rehearsals" permission can create, edit, and delete rehearsals
- Permissions are set per band in the user_permissions table

## Next Steps for Full Implementation

1. **Testing & Refinement** ✅
   - Test CRUD operations for schedules and rehearsals
   - Verify Google Calendar sync is working
   - Test rehearsals appearing in dashboard
   - Verify permissions system works correctly

2. **Enhanced Features** (Future)
   - Recurring rehearsal generation (auto-create weekly/monthly rehearsals)
   - Attendance tracking for band members
   - Setlist management per rehearsal
   - Integration with Charts library for rehearsal materials
   - Rehearsal reminders/notifications

3. **Testing Suite** (Future)
   - Unit tests for models (Rehearsal, RehearsalSchedule)
   - Feature tests for controllers
   - Frontend tests for Vue components

## Key Design Decisions

1. **Why RehearsalSchedule as parent?**
   - Provides a logical grouping (e.g., "Pre-Tour Rehearsals" vs "Weekly Practice")
   - Stores default location/settings that can be overridden per rehearsal
   - Allows band to have multiple rehearsal types simultaneously
   - Matches the pattern requested: parent tied to band, child is eventable

2. **Why separate from Bookings?**
   - Rehearsals don't have clients, contracts, or payments
   - Different permission needs (members might access rehearsals but not booking finances)
   - Cleaner data model than trying to reuse booking as a parent

3. **Why associations table?**
   - Allows many-to-many: one rehearsal can prepare for multiple bookings
   - One booking can have multiple prep rehearsals
   - Maintains clear separation while enabling useful relationships
